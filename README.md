## TimeDrift

I built TimeDrift to solve a real-world problem my team was facing: when working across locations, even short focus sessions would fall out of sync. Without a shared rhythm tied to real time, we kept hitting small delays that broke momentum and made handoffs clumsy.

TimeDrift is a lightweight timer designed to anchor teams to the real clock without adding complexity. It runs a simple countdown synced to each hour, with visual blocks showing progress at :15, :30, :45, and :00. A chime sounds at the end of every 15-minute block, offering natural reset points that help the team stay coordinated without needing constant check-ins.

This project reflects my approach to solving workflow blockers with lightweight, real-world tools that support agile teamwork without getting in the way.
